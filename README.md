Is Your Rig Too Big?

This app allows you to search for national parks on a map and upon clicking your park of choice, gives you information on specific RV size limits per park, as well as other ammenities offered at the park.

The content will firstly be an explanation of the purpose of the map itself, explaining that each park has limitations to the size of RV they allow. This will also include instructions on how to use the map to choose a specific park. Below the explanation, there will be a map with a search bar and list view.

The user flow would be to read the explanation and instructions and scroll down to the map itself. They will then be able to search by state in a search box to view parks within that state. They can scroll through the list of parks that will populate to the left of the map and click on one either within the list or an icon on the map to have another box pop up and give information on the size limits of the RV that is allowed in that park, as well as other ammenities such as showers, dump stations availability, wifi, etc.
